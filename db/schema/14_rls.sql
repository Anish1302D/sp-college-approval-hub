-- Row-Level Security.
--
-- HOW THIS WORKS
-- The application connects as the `app_user` role and, at the start of every
-- request, tells Postgres who the logged-in person is:
--
--     SET LOCAL app.user_id = '<uuid of the authenticated user>';
--
-- Use SET LOCAL (transaction-scoped), never plain SET, or the value leaks to
-- the next request that reuses the pooled connection.
--
-- IMPORTANT: superusers and table owners bypass RLS. Connecting as `postgres`
-- sees everything regardless of the policies below — that is expected, and is
-- why the app must not use the postgres role.

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Application role
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Created without LOGIN deliberately: choose a password yourself rather than
-- having one committed to the repository.
--
--     ALTER ROLE app_user LOGIN PASSWORD '<your password>';

-- Helpers
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- WHY THESE ARE SECURITY DEFINER
-- A policy expression is itself subject to RLS. A helper that reads `requests`
-- or `approval_actions` while those tables' own policies call that same helper
-- recurses until the stack blows. SECURITY DEFINER makes these helpers read as
-- the (RLS-exempt) owner, which breaks the cycle. search_path is pinned so the
-- elevated body cannot be redirected at a shadowed table.
--
-- Each returns only a boolean, so nothing leaks beyond a visibility yes/no.
